## CONFAB ##

For a time at www.confabsalon.org, CONFAB was a project with Northamptonshire County Council and [Poached Creative](http://www.poachedcreative.com/).

* The site runs on [Perch CMS](https://grabaperch.com/) - you would need to buy a licence to run it. 
* The front end was built off the [Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework, and depends on the Zurb Foundation gem (version 4).
